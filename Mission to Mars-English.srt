2
00:00:44,357 --> 00:00:49,691
four, three, two, one, zero.

3
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,853
Ignition.

4
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:04,775
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one!

5
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:07,816
- Blast off!
- Guys, guys, please, wait! Please!

6
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,107
This is very risky stuff here, and I'm
a highly trained professional astronaut.

7
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:14,352
- Here you go.
- Now, Uncle Phil
will launch another rocket...

8
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:17,152
just as soon as he completes
his fuel intake.

9
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,434
Thanks, darlin'.

10
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:23,230
Now, you know, it takes
six months just to reach Mars.

11
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:28,861
Then a year on the surface, six months
back. It's, like, two years, you know?

12
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:32,933
Anyway, guess what I'm tryin'
to say here is that, um...

13
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,768
you know, this bein' my last night
on Earth and everything...

14
00:01:36,904 --> 00:01:41,526
this could be a very, uh,
precious memory for me.

15
00:01:41,654 --> 00:01:44,226
Nice try.

16
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:46,354
- William, get that thing
out of your nose.
- But I like it.

17
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:48,942
- Don't you talk back to Mommy.
- There you are.

18
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,195
- Hey, Woody.
- Yeah?

19
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,562
Our Mars One crew won't be
heading back to Earth...

20
00:01:57,698 --> 00:02:01,194
till ten days after you guys land
at our base camp with Mars Two.

21
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:02,864
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, thank you, Reneé.

22
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,447
That's a pretty good long rendezvous,
don't you think?

23
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:08,817
- What are you suggesting, Sergei?
- I think maybe you should bring
a baseball bat.

24
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,694
- Yes, we will play American baseball
on Mars, our two crews.
- Oh, please.

25
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:15,657
- We could have ourselves
a little solar system series.
- Half you guys are foreigners.

26
00:02:15,783 --> 00:02:18,355
- We'd crush you.
- No, no, no, because
we have equal crews.

27
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:20,862
We have three men, one woman.
Same handicap.

28
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:23,112
Easy now. That's my wife
you're talking about...

29
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,695
and Terri just happens to be
one hell of a shortstop.

30
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:30,200
Fast pitch, no steals,
batter calls his own strikes.

31
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:33,490
- Thousand bucks make it interesting?
- Oh, winner take all.

32
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:36,023
Good. You bring the balls.

33
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,317
You know the best thing
about our mission?

34
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:41,534
On Mars Two, technically, I outrank her,
so for the first time in our marriage...

35
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,778
she's gonna have to do
everything I say, right, honey?

36
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:47,482
- Yes, honey.
- Yes, honey, sir...

37
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:49,990
with a little salute helps.

38
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,984
- Yes, honey, sir.
- Yeah, I like it. It's good.

39
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,905
- Take that corn up there, all right?
- Yes, sir.

40
00:02:57,037 --> 00:03:00,119
I'm not sure how I feel about NASA
allowing couples...

41
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,734
to go on this type
of mission together.

42
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:07,244
Well, nothin' personal, Terri.
I mean--

43
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:11,781
It-- It's just that it's, uh--
It's a funny feelin'
for those of us stayin' behind.

44
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:14,532
Yes, but you know that all the research
shows that marriage will provide...

45
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:16,987
stability on
these long duration trips.

46
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:20,867
Then they haven't studied
some of the couples I've known.

47
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:24,363
Luke. Come on, baby. He's not comin'.

48
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,157
This isn't right.
I mean,Jim deserves this too.

49
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,913
- All of his friends are here.
- I know.

50
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,446
- It's my last night here.
- Hey!

51
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,451
It's your last night with us too.

52
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,869
- I know. I'm sorry, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

53
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:44,622
- I love you, Deb.
- I love you too.

54
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:47,618
Maybe you should spend
some time with Bobby.

55
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,286
- Yeah, where is he?
- Up in his fort.

56
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:54,791
- Oh. Okay.
- Millions of miles away.

57
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:57,288
Deep space.

58
00:03:57,418 --> 00:04:02,076
So lonesome, so cold.

59
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,165
So lame, Nick.

60
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:10,622
Knock, knock.

61
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,457
Bobby?

62
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:21,622
Your friends are out there playin'.
What are you doin' up here?

63
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:25,878
Who's gonna read to me now at bedtime?

64
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:28,375
Your mother will.

65
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,628
But I like when you do it.

66
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:37,584
- Now we're never gonna finish our book.
- Bobby.

67
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:41,708
Listen, I've been thinkin'
about that too, okay?

68
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,830
And what I figured out was--

69
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:46,916
How about if I bring along my own copy?

70
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:50,959
And then every night wherever I am
I'll read a little bit more of it.

71
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,958
And you and Mommy, you can read a little
bit more of it wherever you are.

72
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,421
And it'll be kind of like
we're reading it together.

73
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,624
'Cause, hey, I don't know about you,
but I'm kind of anxious...

74
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:04,333
to find out how old Ben Gunn
got marooned on that island.

75
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:06,872
- You think that's a good idea?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:07,921
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

77
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,006
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:12,290
Okay.

79
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:30,500
Well, we were afraid
you wouldn't come.

80
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:36,254
- I caught a whiff of your barbecue.
- Oh.

81
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:38,626
- After that--
- Yeah?

82
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:40,883
I was, uh, helpless.

83
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:43,927
All the way out in Galveston?

84
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:46,128
- Somethin' like that.
- Mmm!

85
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:50,292
It's his night, Deb.
I didn't want to spoil it.

86
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:53,795
Spoil it? He has been
going crazy lookin' for you.

87
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,009
Don't ever do that to me again.

88
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,221
- How ya doin'?
- Hey. I'm doin' good.

89
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:04,753
- Here.
- Thanks, man.

90
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:07,010
A lot of people are gonna be
mighty glad to see ya, you know that?

91
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,720
- Yeah.
- Come on. Let's go in.

92
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:12,969
You remember him?

93
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:29,474
- Come on.
- Why don't you just let that go?

94
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:32,765
- As soon as you admit that
it was a no-go situation.
- It was a go situation.

95
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,930
Three months, no data stream,
you're gonna land the ship anyway?

96
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,015
Just because you keep bringing it up
doesn't make you right.

97
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:39,466
Just because you get loud
doesn't make--Jim, settle it.

98
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:41,308
- No, no, don't-- Don't look at me.
- Settle it.

99
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,472
- It's a go situation.
- Well, th-- this is exactly
what I'm talkin' about.

100
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:46,718
- It's hard to admit. I know that.
- Come on. Three commanders. One ship.

101
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:48,392
I don't think that's gonna work.

102
00:06:48,518 --> 00:06:52,051
There's not enough rocket fuel in the
world to get those egos off the ground.

103
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:56,594
- Come on.
- Ah, we would have made a great crew.

104
00:06:56,728 --> 00:07:00,888
- Maybe. If this man was left seat.
- Yep.

105
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,805
Guys, come on. I'm a--
I'm a pretty good stick jockey.

106
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:07,350
- You call me if you need a flight test.
- What is a-- What is a stick jockey?

107
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:10,394
- ""I'm a pretty good stick jockey.""
- Come on, Mr Cover of Time Magazine.

108
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,761
The guy who landed
a crippled Block II shuttle.

109
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:15,183
- Yeah. That's the stick jockey.
- The stick jockey did that?

110
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:17,470
- Yeah, yeah, Mr Stick Jockey.
- Okay, all right.

111
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:20,473
I made a little noise, but
putting the first footprints on Mars?

112
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,730
That's for guys who wrote their Ph.D.
thesis on how to colonize the place...

113
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:29,892
and for guys who read too much
science fiction as a kid...

114
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:32,938
- and still wear these little Flash
Gordon rocket ships around their necks.
- Yeah.

115
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:36,846
- Very, very mature.
- Yeah, you read every damn
science fiction book I did.

116
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:40,597
And you're just not man enough to wear
jewellery. That's all there is to that.

117
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:44,313
- Give me it.
- No, no, no.
- Yeah. Take it. Get it.

118
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:48,103
You know you want Flash here.
You ain't gettin' him! Oh, no!

119
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:53,021
Yeah, Maggie would have loved to see
you two clowns just one more time.

120
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,982
I'm gonna go and get a beer.

121
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:22,942
I don't know, Woodrow.
I think it's about time
you donated this baby to the museum.

122
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,147
Internal combustion, boys.
Accept no substitutes.

123
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,648
Jim, listen.

124
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:33,727
If there's, um--

125
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:38,106
- If there's anything that Terri and I
can do, you call us, all right?
- I'm okay. I'm okay. Really.

126
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,151
- All right.
- Thanks.

127
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,821
- Luke.
- Yep.

128
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:44,776
I'll see you when I get to Mars.
Listen. Don't solve all the mysteries
of the universe, all right?

129
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:47,276
- Leave a little somethin'
for the next guys.
- I'm not promisin' anything.

130
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:49,729
- You just bring some expensive beer.
- All right.

131
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:52,946
- Will do. Godspeed.
- Thanks, buddy.

132
00:09:00,282 --> 00:09:03,067
It should have been your mission,Jim.

133
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:05,273
Yours and Maggie's.

134
00:09:07,116 --> 00:09:10,731
Nobody ever wanted Mars
the way you two did, not even Woody.

135
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:14,279
You two were 1 2 years training for
this thing, hoping for this assignment.

136
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:17,111
- It's--
- Well, that's-- That's all over now.

137
00:09:17,242 --> 00:09:19,197
If Maggie hadn't gotten sick,
if you hadn't pulled yourself...

138
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,282
out of the rotation
to take care of her, I mean, you--

139
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,324
- Luke. Come on.
- No,Jim. Wait a minute.

140
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:26,940
I want to say this.

141
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:29,281
Look, I wanted
this assignment, all right?

142
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,483
But not like this,Jim.

143
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:38,449
I would give all of this up in a second
if it would bring Maggie back to us.

144
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:43,075
I know that.

145
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:47,777
Look, all the years
of training and planning
for this mission have been a privilege.

146
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:51,869
Mars is yours now.

147
00:09:51,996 --> 00:09:54,116
Go get it.

148
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,782
I will.

149
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:59,911
You take care of yourself,Jim.

150
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:05,204
You too, buddy.

151
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,033
Okay.

152
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:10,534
I'll see you when I get back.

153
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:14,368
Hey, Luke.

154
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:19,078
Have a great ride.

155
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:22,323
Always do.

156
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:56,132
- Luke, do you read me?
- Yeah, Reneé.

157
00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:58,635
Luke, I just got ARES-8 on-line, and--

158
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:02,805
Well, we-- we think you're gonna
want to see this for yourself.

159
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:04,887
Okay, copy that.

160
00:13:06,598 --> 00:13:08,720
- Now, is this a cinder cone?
- No, it's too smooth.

161
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:12,132
It's, uh, too angular.
Volcanic upwelling maybe.

162
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:16,889
- No, no fissure, no caldera.
- No, it's an upwelling for sure,
but maybe not volcanic.

163
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:20,963
I mean, look at the colour and how shiny
it is. That almost looks like--

164
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,182
- It looks like ice.
- This far south?

165
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:27,011
Impossible. You can't have ice
at this latitude.

166
00:13:27,143 --> 00:13:29,631
I mean, not unless
there's like a--

167
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:35,763
- Okay, how far away is that?
- Sixteen kilometres, northeast.

168
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:37,848
Take us 20 minutes
to get there, Chief.

169
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:40,513
Okay, we're gonna send a packet
to Micker. We're going out there.

170
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:42,599
- Keep working.
- Okay.

171
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:57,637
- Careful. Watch your step.
- Yes, sir.

172
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,844
- Is it possible to take picture?
- Oh, picture.

173
00:13:59,978 --> 00:14:02,681
- Come, please.
- Let's have a picture.

174
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:04,768
Say cheese.

175
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:08,477
This is a truly
anomalous formation.

176
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:10,928
It's unlike anything
ever seen so far.

177
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:13,018
The structure appears
to be crystalline...

178
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:15,636
at least from the angle
that's displayed by ARES-8.

179
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:19,766
Now, we're trying not to go
too nuts up here, but we think
there's a good chance...

180
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:23,513
that this could be an extrusion
from some subsurface
geothermal column of water.

181
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:25,686
And, of course,
if that's correct...

182
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:28,849
then we may have found the key
to permanent human colonization.

183
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:32,513
- We think it wise to suspend judgement
here until we take our samples...
- Let geology and hydrology know...

184
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:35,019
- and do a thorough investigation
of the area.
- we need to scramble on this,
full-court press.

185
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:37,306
So we're gonna head out there ASAP
and take a look at this thing...

186
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:39,680
try and get an idea
of its composition.

187
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:42,684
By the time you receive this,
we should just about be on site.

188
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:16,443
Anybody else hearing that?

189
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,774
Yeah. What is it?

190
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:23,064
I don't know. It sounds like, uh,
interference from the rover.

191
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:27,439
- Can you fix it?
- Hey, Skip, I can fix anything.

192
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:29,112
Love that modesty.

193
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:39,352
Break out the radar.
Let's see what this thing's made of.

194
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:42,775
Oh, yes, there's one more thing.

195
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:46,817
Now, this is a very important,
very special day for a good friend
of ours back home.

196
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:48,903
We know he's there right now.

197
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:53,240
Now he hates it when anybody
makes any kind of a fuss about him,
so I'm not gonna mention his name.

198
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:57,442
'Cause the last thing I would want
to do would be to embarrass
someone likejim McConnell!

199
00:15:58,782 --> 00:16:01,734
Was that loud?
Oh, well, it's done now.

200
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:05,067
I mean, it can't be right. It says
there's metal under there. Solid metal.

201
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,819
No, that doesn't make any sense.
You're reading a vein of ore, Reneé.

202
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:10,948
No, it-- It says
it's under the whole mountain.

203
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:16,199
All right. Move it closer, up the power,
and we're gonna try it again.

204
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:21,778
- Hey!
- Happy birthday to you

205
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,027
Happy birthday to you

206
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,783
Okay, everybody, I want you
to take a look at jim.

207
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,447
- Happy birthday, dearjim
- Now, is he all red
with one of those fake...

208
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:31,533
""Oh, I'm-a-good-sport""grins
on his face?

209
00:16:31,661 --> 00:16:34,196
- Happy birthday to you
- That's right. Now, everybody,
take-- take a look at Ray.

210
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:37,990
Does he have one of those
""This-wasn't-in-my-mission-plan""
looks on his face? Yeah.

211
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,691
Uh-huh. Thought so. Well, there's
nothing you can do about it, Ray.

212
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:43,282
We're a hundred million miles away!

213
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:45,817
Okay, let's blow it out.

214
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:48,656
- We're all set here, Chief.
- All right, let's crank up the juice...

215
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:50,743
see what's in this sucker.

216
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:15,994
What happened?

217
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:32,504
Oh, my God!

218
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,836
- You gettin' that, Sergei?
- Uh-huh.

219
00:19:28,971 --> 00:19:30,961
Oh, my God! Reneé!

220
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:43,385
Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh,Jesus! Oh,Jesus!

221
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:55,059
Problem: hatch door malfunction,
backup power fail, manual override fail.

222
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:59,181
- Solution?
- Replace optical relay.

223
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:02,311
Piece of cake. God,
who dreams up these nightmares?

224
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:04,512
- Don't try to change the subject.
- I'm not.

225
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:06,685
- We're talking about
your sister's wedding, right?
- No, we're talking about...

226
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:09,053
- dancing lessons
before my sister's wedding.
- This is a nightmare.

227
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:14,344
Do you mind? I'm in the middle of a
catastrophic power failure here. Check.

228
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,472
- Not effective.
- Not effective?

229
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:19,438
- Replace optical relay.
- You're distracting me.

230
00:21:19,564 --> 00:21:23,394
Woody, we're a married couple.
Would it kill you to invite me out
on the dance floor just once in a while?

231
00:21:23,524 --> 00:21:27,103
- We danced. We danced
at our wedding. We danced.
- No. That's not dancing, Woody.

232
00:21:27,232 --> 00:21:30,812
That's you shuffling your feet
around while you grab my butt.

233
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:33,063
I'm talking about real dancing,
you know?

234
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:36,806
Cha-cha-cha, rhumba, jitterbug.

235
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:40,935
Darling, face it.
Some couples dance. Some go to Mars.

236
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,188
That's life. Test.

237
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:47,224
Effective. Yeah.
Woody, I'm serious.

238
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,895
Just as soon as we get back home,
we're starting lessons.

239
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:54,483
- Uh-huh.
- Woody, if we never dance, people
are gonna think there's something wrong.

240
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:57,643
If they see me dance,
they'll know there's something wrong.

241
00:21:57,777 --> 00:22:00,348
This is highly unprofessional.

242
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,982
- This is highly unprofessional, sir.
You keep forgetting that ""sir.""
- Sir.

243
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:06,186
Cockpit, this is Control.

244
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,401
- Cockpit, this is Control.
- Control, this is Cockpit.

245
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:13,143
Yeah, Terri, it's Phil. They want us
all to report to Micker ASAP.

246
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,273
- Who says to report to Micker?
- The little men who live in my head.

247
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:22,559
Well, that's a negative, Phil.
We're in the middle of a catastrophic
power failure right now.

248
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:27,354
Yeah, Woody, it was Ray Beck.
He told me to round up the team. Now.

249
00:22:27,488 --> 00:22:29,645
The exact same moment
that we lost the data stream...

250
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:33,395
they picked up
this intense burst of energy from Mars.

251
00:22:33,531 --> 00:22:37,192
- What do you mean intense?
- Catastrophic.

252
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,611
What about the crew?

253
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,777
The level of energy in the pulse
didn't seem survivable.

254
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,862
How about the REMO?

255
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,610
It went into Mars' orbit last week.
Maybe it could give us some clue.

256
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:54,110
That's just what we tried next.

257
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:57,274
All right. The, uh,
resupply module checked out fine.

258
00:22:57,408 --> 00:23:01,900
No instrument failures. Orbit holding
steady, but there was something else.

259
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:04,024
The REMO's computer
contained an uplink message--

260
00:23:04,158 --> 00:23:07,856
a very faint, highly distorted
transmission from Mars One base camp.

261
00:23:07,993 --> 00:23:11,405
- Someone's alive.
- Yes, yes, yes. Put up the message.

262
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:14,403
Still concentrating on the audio,
but we've got a long way to go.

263
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:17,818
Show us whatever you've got.
Show us.

264
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:24,740
I have to make this--
make this fast.

265
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:30,909
I may not get another chance to--
to make-- another chance-- chance--

266
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:33,739
to the site-- site.

267
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,821
There was a low sound that--

268
00:23:36,953 --> 00:23:39,656
a low sound-- sound--
a low sound--

269
00:23:39,787 --> 00:23:42,620
Something came out of the top
of the mountain, and it hit us.

270
00:23:42,746 --> 00:23:45,698
And-- it hit us-- it hit us.

271
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,118
Oh, my God!

272
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:52,991
They're dead.

273
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:56,737
God! Nick-- Man! They're dead.

274
00:23:56,872 --> 00:23:58,827
That's it.

275
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:03,987
I don't know.
Luke must be in pretty bad shape...

276
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:07,324
if he hasn't just blasted out of there
in the Earth Return Vehicle.

277
00:24:07,457 --> 00:24:10,823
That thing's designed so even one
crew member can fly it back to Earth.

278
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:13,280
Even if Luke was in great shape,
he couldn't get home.

279
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:16,367
An energy pulse of that magnitude
would have fried the ERV's computers.

280
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:18,573
Other than the computers,
how do we think the ERV fared?

281
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,457
Well, so far, our modelling says
it should be in pretty good shape.

282
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,574
Which means it's gonna be up to us
to get new motherboards...

283
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:26,162
drives and software to Mars
as fast as we can.

284
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:28,413
- Right.
- Slow it down. Slow it down.
Slow it down.

285
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:31,457
It's gonna take us weeks
just to analyse this data.

286
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:35,281
Right, right, but in the meantime,
we gotta be workin' up a mission plan.

287
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:39,364
- Luke needs us now.
- Luke may already be dead.

288
00:24:39,502 --> 00:24:43,163
And even if he's not, it's doubtful he
is going to be able to transmit again.

289
00:24:43,294 --> 00:24:47,998
So we wouldn't know
whether it's safe to land...

290
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:50,699
until we were almost there.

291
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:02,583
What about SIMA?

292
00:25:02,712 --> 00:25:06,493
What about SIMA?
The Saturn imaging probe?

293
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:08,870
It's gonna slingshot around Mars
on its way through the solar system.

294
00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:12,536
It could be retasked
to take pictures, read radiation
levels of Mars One base camp.

295
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:15,623
Wait, wait, wait.
We are getting ahead of ourselves.

296
00:25:15,756 --> 00:25:19,879
You are forgetting the bigger problem.
The orbits are all wrong.

297
00:25:20,005 --> 00:25:23,004
Our first decent launch window
is almost eight months from now.

298
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:25,371
Yes, but we can go earlier
and get there faster...

299
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:27,462
if we reconfigure the payload
for extra fuel.

300
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,913
We've modelled that, Ray.
I've modelled it.

301
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:33,746
On paper, yes, but those stresses
have never been tested in space.

302
00:25:33,882 --> 00:25:37,711
- The ship can take it.
- Oh, ""ship can take it.""

303
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:40,080
I wasn't thinking of just the ship.

304
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:47,795
Ray, I know the protocols for a Mars
recovery mission better than anybody...

305
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:51,007
because I designed them.

306
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,290
And I'm telling you,
these guys can do it.

307
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,542
He's right, Ray.
We got a real shot here.

308
00:26:05,177 --> 00:26:09,550
Well, give me an updated
mission plan by 0800 tomorrow.

309
00:26:09,677 --> 00:26:12,794
You'll have it by 0600.
Let's go to work.

310
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:20,136
- Chief, can I have a word?
- Yeah, go ahead.

311
00:26:22,304 --> 00:26:25,919
- I no longer have the right crew.
- How do you mean?

312
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:28,543
Bjornstrom can be up here
on the next shuttle.

313
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,884
Bjornstrom is a geologist.
He's good, but not for this.

314
00:26:31,013 --> 00:26:32,968
My people just lost
eight months of training.

315
00:26:33,096 --> 00:26:35,218
This is a different mission
with a different objective.

316
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:37,965
- I haven't approved the mission yet.
- Yes, but when you do...

317
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,048
it ought to be given
its best chance for success.

318
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:45,670
I want McConnell to fly right seat.

319
00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:47,843
Oh.

320
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:52,930
Jim McConnell is
no longer on mission status.

321
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,754
- Yeah, because you washed him out.
- He washed himself out.

322
00:26:56,891 --> 00:27:00,221
He only had to pass
a few more psych evaluations...

323
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:03,680
but he refused to take them.

324
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:07,672
His wife was dead. He didn't want to lay
on a couch and share it with strangers.

325
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:10,890
Yeah, that was his call,
but I had to make one too!

326
00:27:11,017 --> 00:27:13,553
It was tough as hell,
but I'd do it again!

327
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:16,255
For Christ's sake, Ray,
she wasted away in front of his eyes.

328
00:27:16,393 --> 00:27:19,474
What was he supposed to do, suck it up?
Get with the programme?

329
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:21,924
What was his crime? That he--
That he showed a little emotion?

330
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,177
I couldn't trust him!

331
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,557
When Maggie died,
it knocked the hell out of him.

332
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:31,221
It knocked the hell
out of all of us.

333
00:27:31,353 --> 00:27:33,676
But you know and I know
he's still the best we got.

334
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:35,766
He and Maggie
wrote the book on Mars.

335
00:27:35,894 --> 00:27:38,466
He's had more hours in the sims
than the rest of us put together.

336
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:40,594
We can do this, Ray.

337
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:43,845
You give me McConnell as copilot,
and we will bring Luke home.

338
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:45,934
It's a promise.

339
00:28:38,526 --> 00:28:42,602
Hey. What's that?

340
00:28:42,735 --> 00:28:48,814
That is the exact genetic composition
of my ideal woman.

341
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:57,142
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

342
00:28:59,111 --> 00:29:01,268
My baby.

343
00:29:02,695 --> 00:29:06,559
- Now what is it?
- A frog?

344
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:22,066
- Hey, Skip.
- Hey. Take a look.

345
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:27,194
Damn.

346
00:29:27,322 --> 00:29:31,364
- What do you make of that?
- Dust storm.

347
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,694
Southern hemisphere,
comin' from the east.

348
00:29:33,823 --> 00:29:35,779
It's a big fella too.

349
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,904
-Headed straight for Mars One base camp.
-Yep.

350
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:41,153
Could get a little hairy
right about landing time.

351
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:43,237
Yeah.

352
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:47,691
Listen, we're gonna have to be able to
move fast, maybe even advance our ETA.

353
00:29:47,825 --> 00:29:51,486
These bad boys can cover a whole planet
and last up to a year.

354
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:55,361
- When does SIMA do her fly-by?
- Tomorrow morning, 0600.

355
00:29:55,491 --> 00:29:59,154
That's when we find out whether
we've come all this way for nothin'.

356
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:03,315
My money's on Luke.

357
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:32,287
Have you seen her
so fine and pretty

358
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,577
Fooled me with her style and ease

359
00:30:35,705 --> 00:30:39,284
And I feel her
from across the room

360
00:30:39,413 --> 00:30:43,988
Yes, it's love
in the third degree

361
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:47,204
Ooh, baby, baby

362
00:30:47,331 --> 00:30:51,703
Won't ya turn your head my way

363
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:54,615
Ooh, baby, baby

364
00:30:54,748 --> 00:30:58,528
Come on, take a chance
You're old enough to

365
00:30:58,664 --> 00:31:01,201
Dance

366
00:31:01,332 --> 00:31:03,287
The night away

367
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,205
Whoa

368
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:10,868
Dance the night away

369
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:16,738
A live wire, barely a beginner

370
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,205
But just watch that lady go

371
00:31:20,334 --> 00:31:24,280
She's on fire 'cause
dancin'gets her higher

372
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:28,791
Than anything else she knows

373
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:31,832
Ooh, baby, baby

374
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,203
Won't ya turn your head my way

375
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:39,417
Ooh, baby, baby

376
00:31:39,544 --> 00:31:42,827
All those interested in dance lessons,
please report to the promenade deck.

377
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:47,574
Dance the night away

378
00:31:49,795 --> 00:31:52,912
Whoa

379
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:56,577
Dance the night away

380
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:01,128
Oh

381
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:04,537
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

382
00:32:23,382 --> 00:32:25,337
And what, may I ask,
brought this on?

383
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:29,376
Zero G, my friend.
My last chance to be graceful.

384
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:34,627
Once we're in Mars' gravity,
it's back to shufflin' my feet
and grabbin' her butt.

385
00:32:34,758 --> 00:32:39,462
Dance the night away

386
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:42,294
Oh, baby

387
00:32:42,425 --> 00:32:47,249
Dance, dance, dance
the night away

388
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,752
Oh, come on, dance

389
00:32:51,885 --> 00:32:53,840
- The night away
- Incoming packet.

390
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:56,421
- Oh, baby
- Incoming packet.

391
00:32:56,552 --> 00:32:59,798
- Dance
- It's SIMA.

392
00:33:01,844 --> 00:33:03,123
Enhanced look at base camp.

393
00:33:06,011 --> 00:33:07,966
- Looks deserted.
- It's still standing, though.

394
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:10,879
So's the ERV. And, look,
there's the greenhouse.

395
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:16,048
Well, we know Luke survived
for at least a few hours.

396
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:19,960
Now, are there any signs
of recent activity?

397
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:23,793
There. Scan northeastern quadrant
of base camp.

398
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:27,968
What the hell are those?

399
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:34,004
- Graves.
- Wait a minute.
There's only three of them.

400
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:36,841
- That means that Luke's still gotta be
alive. It means he's still down there.
- Phil, no, no.

401
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,883
It just means there was
no one left to bury him.

402
00:33:41,014 --> 00:33:43,883
- Check the radiation levels.
- Check rad levels.

403
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:46,133
Normal.

404
00:33:46,265 --> 00:33:49,880
- Go to disaster site.
- Go to 41 by 9.

405
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:55,548
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. Magnetic interference?

406
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:57,803
- Go infrared.
- Switch to infrared.

407
00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:02,636
It's gotta be
a problem with SIMA.

408
00:34:02,766 --> 00:34:07,389
I don't see how an earthquake six months
ago could cause this kind of distortion.

409
00:34:07,517 --> 00:34:09,472
That was no quake.

410
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:36,092
We are going to continue
analysing this data...

411
00:34:36,229 --> 00:34:39,926
and try to determine
what the problem is with those images.

412
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:44,850
We agree that the evidence
of the graves is, uh...

413
00:34:44,979 --> 00:34:46,935
inconclusive...

414
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:50,973
and that a ground search
is advisable.

415
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:55,762
Frankly, we are as stumped
as you guys, but we'll keep on it.

416
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:58,351
Beware there are little
sandstorms kicking up...

417
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:01,763
- Bureau babble.
- near Mars One base.

418
00:35:01,898 --> 00:35:04,683
But the big one
you spotted is turning south.

419
00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:06,770
It shouldn't be a factor.

420
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:10,643
We are pretty excited around here.

421
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:13,725
Well, and we are sure
you must be feeling the same.

422
00:35:13,857 --> 00:35:17,021
- Enjoy your meal and
get a good night's sleep.
- Say it.

423
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:19,768
- We anticipate...
- Say it.

424
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,470
- that tomorrow morning...
- Say it.

425
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:24,765
you will be go.

426
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,724
Yes! Yes!
Thank you! Thank you!

427
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:48,439
Hooray for baby jimmy!

428
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:51,769
Yes, jim's first spaceship
was seriously underpowered.

429
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:53,940
Maggie was always
a little star-struck.

430
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,192
Come on.
Show us those beautiful teeth.

431
00:36:00,362 --> 00:36:03,858
I am gonna get you guys for that!
I am gonna get you.

432
00:36:03,988 --> 00:36:06,274
When they met at the Air Force Academy,
it was love at first flight.

433
00:36:06,404 --> 00:36:09,438
- Woody's line. Woody's line.
- Oh.

434
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:11,645
Later, during NASA training,
things got a little tough.

435
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:16,070
Yes, Maggie always did
keep jim on a short leash.

436
00:36:16,197 --> 00:36:19,528
jim was always trying
to explore a heavenly body.

437
00:36:19,656 --> 00:36:21,196
- Right.
-Ah, yes.

438
00:36:21,322 --> 00:36:24,191
- Well, where are they goin'?
Where are they goin'?
- Ten-thousand-mile-high club.

439
00:36:24,323 --> 00:36:26,609
- That's right.
- Until--

440
00:36:27,823 --> 00:36:29,778
- Mission accomplished.
- Oh!

441
00:36:29,906 --> 00:36:33,687
Man, what a fun wedding.
I was so whacked.

442
00:36:33,823 --> 00:36:37,604
Uh, I'm going in.
T-minus three, T-minus two...

443
00:36:37,741 --> 00:36:39,980
T-minus one, contact.

444
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:42,984
Oh. Okay, we can stop it there.

445
00:36:43,116 --> 00:36:45,071
Stop there. Fast forward.

446
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:47,736
-All right.
-And then what happened?

447
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:50,616
I-- I know what happened.

448
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:54,274
- What nerves.
- Okay, you guys.

449
00:36:54,409 --> 00:36:58,320
They're adding a wonderful chapter
to their incredible story...

450
00:36:58,451 --> 00:37:00,407
and it's a pretty historic one.

451
00:37:00,535 --> 00:37:03,735
To the newly appointed co-commanders
of Mars One, jim and Maggie!

452
00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:06,238
- Hear, hear.
- I will drink to that.

453
00:37:06,368 --> 00:37:07,992
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

454
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:10,074
- Hold it. It's not over.
- Show 'em. Show 'em. Show 'em.

455
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:11,778
- Yeah, we got a little--
a little addendum.
- Oh, yeah, this is good.

456
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,281
- Check this out, guys.
- Here we go. It's Phil's best work.

457
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:18,904
- Oh, yeah.
- Look! It's Mars!

458
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:22,568
You can pick up these postcards
at your local NASA souvenir shop.

459
00:37:22,704 --> 00:37:25,073
You know, when you two land up there,
it will prove once and for all...

460
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:28,819
that there really is
no intelligent life on Mars.

461
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:30,613
-All right. Enough, enough.
- Thanks a lot. Touché.

462
00:37:30,746 --> 00:37:32,287
- You're gonna eat those words.
- I don't think so.

463
00:37:32,413 --> 00:37:33,906
- Everett, give me the camera.
-All right.
- I don't think so.
- Uh-oh, here we go.

464
00:37:34,038 --> 00:37:36,112
- Let me take it away.
- What? What if I'm right?
- Here we go.

465
00:37:36,246 --> 00:37:38,202
- What if she's right?
- Why does it have to be about us?

466
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,784
- You okay?
- Why can't it just be about science?
- Yes.

467
00:37:40,914 --> 00:37:43,747
- We'll do the science,
and we'll do it really well...
- Yeah.

468
00:37:43,873 --> 00:37:45,828
because that's
what we've trained for.

469
00:37:45,956 --> 00:37:48,444
But what if there's more?
In all our myths...

470
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:52,990
in every human culture, Mars has
always held a special attraction.

471
00:37:55,123 --> 00:37:58,620
I mean, what if
that means something?

472
00:37:58,749 --> 00:38:03,454
The universe is-- is not chaos.
It's connection.

473
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:08,075
Life reaches out for life.

474
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:10,246
That's what we were born for,
isn't it?

475
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:14,369
To stand on a new world
and look beyond it to the next one.

476
00:38:16,918 --> 00:38:18,908
It's who we are.

477
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,916
You know, she may have been right.

478
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:37,415
If that wasn't a quake down there,
then something else caused it...

479
00:38:37,544 --> 00:38:40,460
or planned it.

480
00:38:40,587 --> 00:38:43,075
You thinkin' the same thing?

481
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,290
It's never been out of my mind.

482
00:38:53,255 --> 00:38:55,578
I think she knew something, Woody.

483
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:00,287
She was the only one of us
who ever really believed...

484
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:03,207
there might be
something down there.

485
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:09,588
Yeah, well, we're not leaving
until we find out. Deal?

486
00:39:11,965 --> 00:39:13,506
Deal.

487
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:21,087
Range: 67-83 and closing.

488
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:23,965
65 minutes until
Mars orbital capture.

489
00:39:24,091 --> 00:39:27,503
Okay, people, let's look sharp now.
We're gonna run this simulation
one more time.

490
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:30,797
Remember, if we overshoot,
there's no comin' back.

491
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:34,504
Yeah, and drifting through eternity
will ruin your whole day.

492
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:37,964
Okay, Delta-V systems initialized.

493
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:40,546
Charge primary APU.

494
00:39:40,676 --> 00:39:42,750
Engaged and charged.

495
00:39:42,884 --> 00:39:47,956
- Select HPU fuel cells for run.
- Engaged.

496
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:51,341
- Tie main bus to systems.
- Power ready.

497
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:54,752
Select H2O2 HPU
and fuel cells for open.

498
00:39:54,886 --> 00:39:58,832
H2O2 fuel valves open.

499
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:01,007
Charge flow.

500
00:40:01,136 --> 00:40:03,341
Charged and on-line.

501
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:06,338
- Reset PW.
- Set.

502
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,753
Transfer protocol data
from EVA station.

503
00:40:09,887 --> 00:40:14,343
Transferred.
Awaiting track confirmation.

504
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:18,001
Jesus! Oh!

505
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,884
Micrometeoroids.

506
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:32,421
Kill those alarms!

507
00:40:40,973 --> 00:40:45,347
Critical systems alert.
Critical systems alert.

508
00:40:45,474 --> 00:40:48,556
- Breach hits in the hull.
- We're outgassing, losing pressure.

509
00:40:48,683 --> 00:40:52,926
Woody, seal the breach.
Looks like it's behind Jim's helmet.

510
00:40:55,516 --> 00:40:58,847
Ninety percent atmosphere.

511
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:16,969
Critical systems alert.
Critical systems alert.

512
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:27,682
We're losing pressure fast.
We're gonna decompress!

513
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,976
Computer, how long
till zero atmosphere?

514
00:41:34,646 --> 00:41:37,015
Four minutes, nine seconds.

515
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:40,977
We're still outgassing
in the lower hab.

516
00:41:41,105 --> 00:41:44,435
There must be another hole down there.
It's gotta be a big one.

517
00:41:44,564 --> 00:41:46,969
Everybody switch to suit oxygen.
Jim, you've got the ship.

518
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:49,097
- I'm going EVA.
- Copy.

519
00:41:49,231 --> 00:41:51,056
Come on, people.
Let's work the problem.

520
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:59,637
Eighty percent atmosphere.

521
00:41:59,773 --> 00:42:02,558
Jim, you got to go get
your spare helmet.

522
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:07,390
Copy that,Jim?

523
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:11,849
There's no time.
All the systems have crashed.

524
00:42:11,982 --> 00:42:14,223
I gotta shut down the hab
from below.

525
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:18,269
We're losing pressure,Jim.
You could embolize.

526
00:42:33,776 --> 00:42:36,691
Seventy percent atmosphere.

527
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:52,859
Phil, you've got to get
the nav computers back on-line.

528
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,108
Uh,Jim, I've got an idea.

529
00:42:55,237 --> 00:42:57,275
If you guys can save
enough atmosphere...

530
00:42:57,404 --> 00:43:00,687
I'll disconnect the power in the main
computer bay and jump-start the systems.

531
00:43:00,821 --> 00:43:04,518
- I'd basically be doing a hard boot.
- Has that been tested?

532
00:43:04,655 --> 00:43:09,727
Are you kidding?
These machines are way too expensive.

533
00:43:09,863 --> 00:43:14,486
- Do it.
- Okay. I think this will work.

534
00:43:18,614 --> 00:43:21,447
Sixty percent atmosphere.

535
00:44:00,827 --> 00:44:05,450
-Jim, how we doing on the AG?
-Just hang on one second, Woody.

536
00:44:05,578 --> 00:44:08,066
- Fifty percent atmosphere.
- Come on.

537
00:44:08,202 --> 00:44:10,360
- Come on.
-Jim, I've got oxygen.

538
00:44:10,495 --> 00:44:14,536
- Come on.
- Voice print identification.

539
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:17,115
- Mc-- McCon--
- Not accepted.

540
00:44:17,246 --> 00:44:19,781
Voice print identification.

541
00:44:19,912 --> 00:44:22,531
- McConnell!
- Accepted.

542
00:44:22,662 --> 00:44:25,330
Shut down gravitational rotation.

543
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:28,025
Shutting down artificial
gravitational rotation.

544
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,495
Jim, I've got the oxygen for you.

545
00:44:39,831 --> 00:44:42,829
- Hang on!
- Forty percent atmosphere.

546
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,663
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

547
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:56,365
- I'm topside,Jim.
Do you know which sector?
- I'm working on it.

548
00:44:56,499 --> 00:45:00,115
- You better get some oxygen,Jim.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

549
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,203
Come on.

550
00:45:13,918 --> 00:45:16,240
Jesus.

551
00:45:16,376 --> 00:45:18,616
It's like lookin' for a needle
in a haystack.

552
00:45:18,752 --> 00:45:21,667
Okay, come on.

553
00:45:21,794 --> 00:45:24,282
Come on. Where are you,
you little bastard?

554
00:45:24,418 --> 00:45:26,908
Give me some light on the hull
so I can locate it.

555
00:45:27,044 --> 00:45:29,579
I got a better idea.

556
00:45:34,461 --> 00:45:36,832
Gotcha.

557
00:45:36,962 --> 00:45:40,541
Terri.

558
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,041
Squeeze out the liquid.

559
00:45:44,295 --> 00:45:46,666
S-Stay there.

560
00:45:46,796 --> 00:45:49,249
- Squeeze it out.
-Jim.

561
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:53,836
Okay. Okay. Please work.

562
00:46:00,672 --> 00:46:03,078
Thirty percent atmosphere.

563
00:46:06,673 --> 00:46:10,501
Woody, the breach is between
sectors five and six.

564
00:46:11,632 --> 00:46:16,255
- Five and six. Do you copy?
- Copy. I'm headin'there now.

565
00:46:18,633 --> 00:46:21,999
Son of a bitch.
You never did that in a simulator.

566
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:28,047
- Twenty percent atmosphere.
- Jim?

567
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:41,877
- Ten percent atmosphere.
- Jim!

568
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:48,334
Jim, talk to me. It's Terri.

569
00:46:53,095 --> 00:46:55,583
-Jim.
- Come back.

570
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:57,794
- Breathe!
- Come back!

571
00:46:59,554 --> 00:47:01,544
Gotcha.

572
00:47:03,179 --> 00:47:06,426
Pressure stabilizing.
Pressure stabilizing.

573
00:47:08,388 --> 00:47:11,967
-Jim?
- Twenty percent atmosphere.

574
00:47:14,514 --> 00:47:17,002
Hi. Welcome back.

575
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:19,971
Thirty percent atmosphere.

576
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:24,256
It worked! Yes! It worked!

577
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,091
Way to go, everybody.
All right! Yeah!

578
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,931
There's a lot of scarring out here.
I'm gonna check for other punctures.

Orbital insertion proximity alert.
Orbital insertion proximity alert.

580
00:47:38,224 --> 00:47:41,057
Negative, Woody. That is a negative.
You have to get back inside.

581
00:47:41,183 --> 00:47:43,588
We have to do our checklist
for orbital insertion.

582
00:47:43,724 --> 00:47:45,679
Copy. I'm on my way.

583
00:47:48,683 --> 00:47:50,721

00:49:09,317 --> 00:49:11,390
Six.

598
00:49:15,067 --> 00:49:16,394
Five.

599
00:49:19,567 --> 00:49:22,187
Orbital insertion
proximity alert.

600
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:25,269
- Four.
- Optimum insertion angle approaching.

601
00:49:25,402 --> 00:49:27,558
Jim?

602
00:49:27,693 --> 00:49:29,021
Three.

603
00:49:34,486 --> 00:49:37,519
Optimum insertion angle imminent.

604
00:49:39,819 --> 00:49:40,981
Two.

605
00:49:44,903 --> 00:49:47,522
- One.
- Let's go to Mars.

606
00:49:52,113 --> 00:49:53,570
Jesus!

607
00:49:56,196 --> 00:49:59,396
-Attitude incorrect.
- Shut down the engines.

608
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:07,272
Engines negative. No response.
I have got no attitude control.

609
00:50:07,406 --> 00:50:09,859
- Manual separation. Blow the bolts.
- Negative. The control module...

610
00:50:09,989 --> 00:50:12,027
doesn't have enough thrust
to correct this rotation.

611
00:50:12,156 --> 00:50:14,988
We're too steep.
We're falling into the atmosphere.

612
00:50:15,114 --> 00:50:17,070
Christ, at this angle,
we're gonna burn up.

613
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:22,441
- How much time we got, Phil?
- I don't know. Three minutes?
I don't know.

614
00:50:22,574 --> 00:50:25,525
- Where's the REMO?
- The resupply module? Why? There's
no way we're gonna be able to link up.

615
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:27,731
Where is it?

616
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:32,240
Resupply module located.
Resupply module located.

617
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:33,481
- It's close.
- How close?

618
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:35,691
- I don't know.
That's gonna take some time.
- Figure it out.

619
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:37,401
We don't have time, Phil.
Figure it out now.

620
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,856
Jim, we're dead stick. There's no way
to manoeuvre this ship into linkup.

621
00:50:42,617 --> 00:50:46,314
Not the ship.Just us.
We go EVA.

622
00:50:46,451 --> 00:50:49,449
- You want us to transfer in suits?
-Jesus,Jim, if we don't make it--

623
00:50:49,576 --> 00:50:51,781
- If we miss the REMO--
- There's no other choice.

624
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:55,406
- Phil, how close?
- Intersection orbit with REMO.

625
00:50:56,577 --> 00:50:59,244
Course intersection plotted.

626
00:50:59,369 --> 00:51:02,119
One kilometre.
That's the best I can do.

627
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:05,615
Prepare to abandon ship.

628
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:08,784
Let's go!

629
00:52:19,294 --> 00:52:21,913
- What are you looking for?
- Earth.

630
00:52:23,919 --> 00:52:28,909
Hey, when we get back home, we really
will have to try this out in the sim.

631
00:52:30,128 --> 00:52:32,795
How we doing on the fuel, Woody?

632
00:52:32,921 --> 00:52:36,535
I'm at 50 percent.
I don't see the REMO.

633
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:05,547
There it is.
Forty-five left, forty-five down.

634
00:53:05,673 --> 00:53:08,079
Oh,Jesus. She's not
where I thought she'd be.

635
00:53:08,216 --> 00:53:10,538
- We're gonna miss her.
- What do you think?

636
00:53:11,716 --> 00:53:14,750
We can't catch it.
Not like this.

637
00:53:14,883 --> 00:53:18,414
Use the tether. You'll have one, maybe
two shots before she's out of reach.

638
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:21,039
Negative. It's too risky.
If we miss her, we got nothing.

639
00:53:22,383 --> 00:53:25,216
I'll leave you the gun.
Run a line out to the REMO.

640
00:53:25,342 --> 00:53:28,092
I got enough fuel left for that.

641
00:53:28,218 --> 00:53:30,836
- You'll be going too fast.
- I'll aim to overshoot.

642
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:36,505
Brake like hell and arc it in.
Piece of cake.

643
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:40,883
I'll see you in a flash.

644
00:53:47,386 --> 00:53:50,337
Unhook me.

645
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:52,508
Good to go.

646
00:54:11,847 --> 00:54:16,055
Okay, I'm on a path to overshoot.
I'm gonna take the edge off.

647
00:54:23,348 --> 00:54:27,556
I'm out of fuel.
Coming in hot. Still long.

648
00:54:33,975 --> 00:54:36,380
Abandoning the unit.
I'll break with suit jets.

649
00:54:41,392 --> 00:54:44,059
Jesus.Jesus.

650
00:54:49,976 --> 00:54:52,595
Suit jets gone.
I'm gonna make contact.

651
00:54:53,684 --> 00:54:56,848
- What velocity?
- Impact's gonna be a little rough.

652
00:54:56,976 --> 00:54:58,718
- At what velocity?
- Thirty-two.

653
00:55:02,894 --> 00:55:04,884
- I'm gonna use the gun to slow you.
- No.

654
00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:07,056
- If you slow me, I'll fall short.
- It's too fast, Woody.

655
00:55:07,186 --> 00:55:10,432
No choice. I'll be okay.
Here we go!

656
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:13,893
Gotcha.

657
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,727
Woody!

658
00:55:17,854 --> 00:55:19,679
Woody!

659
00:55:21,895 --> 00:55:24,100
Woody! Woody!

660
00:55:24,229 --> 00:55:26,469
Woody. Woody.

661
00:55:26,604 --> 00:55:29,686
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Woody. Woody.

662
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,436
- Terri.
- Woody.

663
00:55:36,564 --> 00:55:39,313
Take the gun. Take it.

664
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:43,766
Phil, hang on. Go.

665
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,480
Woody, what's your status?

666
00:55:53,608 --> 00:55:58,977
Well, uh, my suit jets are gone, and I'm
still carrying a good deal of velocity.

667
00:55:59,108 --> 00:56:01,477
Soon as we get hooked up,
I'll come get you.

668
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,559
- I'd have to say negative on that,Jim.
- Negative on the transmission?

669
00:56:04,691 --> 00:56:08,104
No, I heard you. Negative on the
manoeuvre. I am not retrievable.

670
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:11,599
- Woody, you're not going that fast.
- Well, it all comes down
to the amount of fuel, honey.

671
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:14,602
Suit jets are designed
for attitude control, not travel.

672
00:56:14,734 --> 00:56:17,401
- Retrieval just won't work.
- Well, it's gotta work.

673
00:56:17,526 --> 00:56:20,478
Hey, listen. I don't like it
any more than you do.

674
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,933
- Woody.
- Run the numbers,Jim.

675
00:56:23,068 --> 00:56:25,023
I am.

676
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:31,519
You hang tight, Woody.

677
00:56:31,652 --> 00:56:33,976
We'll get in the REMO, drop her down
and come scoop you up.

678
00:56:34,111 --> 00:56:38,105
- Sounds good,Jim.
- It's gonna take us half an hour
to get the REMO reoriented.

679
00:56:38,236 --> 00:56:40,192
Woody will be
in the atmosphere by then.

680
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,521
- Then we'll just have to
get her moving faster.
- We don't have time.

681
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:45,728
Listen to Jim, honey.
It's a good plan.

682
00:56:45,862 --> 00:56:49,477
No. We're gonna come get you.

683
00:56:52,363 --> 00:56:54,401
- Okay. Get ready for brakes.
- Come on, now.

684
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:55,987
- On my mark. Three...
- You can do it.

685
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:57,488
- two...
- You can do it!
- one.

686
00:56:57,613 --> 00:56:59,687
- Come on!
- Mark!
- Come on!

687
00:57:01,322 --> 00:57:02,566
Yeah!

688
00:57:02,697 --> 00:57:04,688
Yeah!

689
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:08,396
- Everybody good?
- We're on,Jim.

690
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,568
Way to go. Way to go.

691
00:57:13,574 --> 00:57:15,529
Good job.

692
00:57:15,657 --> 00:57:18,145
All right. There won't be
enough room for us inside.

693
00:57:19,866 --> 00:57:22,189
Soon as I get the hatch open,
let's start dumping the cargo.

694
00:57:22,324 --> 00:57:24,149
- Copy that.
- Hang on, Woody.

695
00:57:24,283 --> 00:57:26,238
Will do,Jim.

696
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:35,277
Hello, beautiful.

697
00:57:39,201 --> 00:57:41,238
Come on.

698
00:57:41,368 --> 00:57:43,406
All right. It's open.

699
00:57:47,618 --> 00:57:50,403
- Terri, no!
- Terri! Come back!

700
00:57:52,077 --> 00:57:53,618
You'll never make it!

701
00:57:53,744 --> 00:57:57,406
- Terri, what are you doing?
- I'll tell you
what I'm not doing, Woody.

702
00:57:57,536 --> 00:58:00,534
- I'm not gonna watch you die.
- Terri.

703
00:58:00,662 --> 00:58:02,487
You'd do the same for me.

704
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,902
Phil, get inside, dump the cargo
and start the systems. Now!

705
00:58:06,037 --> 00:58:08,870
- No, I wouldn't.
Not if it was impossible.
- I can do it!

706
00:58:08,996 --> 00:58:12,326
No, you can't. You don't have enough
fuel to come get me and get us back.

707
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:17,578
Listen to me, goddamn it. You have
to stop, and you have to stop now.

708
00:58:17,705 --> 00:58:20,952
He's right, Terri.
It's no use.

709
00:58:36,665 --> 00:58:38,040
Okay, honey.

710
00:58:41,249 --> 00:58:43,370
You gotta go back now.

711
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:47,489
The hell I do.

712
00:59:27,378 --> 00:59:30,163
What are you doing?

713
00:59:30,296 --> 00:59:33,164
I'm gonna jet in a little closer
and try again.

714
00:59:33,296 --> 00:59:36,413
Terri, you spend any fuel
getting closer, you won't get back.

715
00:59:36,546 --> 00:59:38,833
And if anyone tries to get you,
they'll die too.

716
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:44,045
Honey, please.
Please go back.

717
00:59:46,214 --> 00:59:48,252
Go back and help the others
to the surface.

718
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:51,706
I am not losing you!

719
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,252
I can't let you do it.

720
00:59:55,381 --> 00:59:58,996
- I can't let you die. I'm sorry.
- Woody.

721
00:59:59,131 --> 01:00:01,170
What are you doing?

722
01:00:01,299 --> 01:00:03,089
- Love you, honey.
- Woody--

723
01:00:03,216 --> 01:00:06,167
No. No!

724
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:09,630
- God, how I love you.
- Woody! Don't!

725
01:00:10,842 --> 01:00:14,172
Woody! Woody!

726
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:18,792
Woody! Don't! No!

727
01:00:21,426 --> 01:00:25,254
No! Please, God, no!

728
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:32,547
Woody.

729
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,046
Woody.

730
01:00:42,845 --> 01:00:44,503
Come back, Terri.

731
01:00:46,053 --> 01:00:48,969
- He's gone.
- No.

732
01:00:50,887 --> 01:00:53,008
No.

733
01:00:53,137 --> 01:00:55,175
- Terri.
- No.

734
01:00:56,846 --> 01:00:59,169
We need you.

735
01:00:59,305 --> 01:01:01,130
Woody.

736
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,802
No.

737
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:11,133
No. No.

738
01:01:12,306 --> 01:01:14,344
No.

739
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,595
No.

740
01:01:20,557 --> 01:01:22,512
Please, Terri.

741
01:01:23,723 --> 01:01:25,679
Come back.

742
01:02:00,102 --> 01:02:03,433
Ray. We've got some new data
just coming in.

743
01:02:04,769 --> 01:02:07,305
We just--
It doesn't make any sense.

744
01:02:07,437 --> 01:02:09,557
We're not sure how to read this.

745
01:02:09,686 --> 01:02:12,057
- Data?
- Yes.

746
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:16,263
Telemetry reports the REMO left its
orbit and reached the Martian surface.

747
01:02:16,395 --> 01:02:21,184
- Crashed?
- No, sir. Under power.

748
01:02:21,313 --> 01:02:24,346
- What?
- Sixty-three minutes
after Mars Recovery went off-line.

749
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,636
Sir, the graph shows
a controlled descent...

750
01:02:26,771 --> 01:02:28,928
but that doesn't make any sense.

751
01:02:32,856 --> 01:02:35,143
They used the REMO as a lander.

752
01:02:35,273 --> 01:02:38,057
It's-- It's Jim McConnell.
It's got to be.

753
01:02:38,189 --> 01:02:40,939
Nobody else could have pulled this off.
Nobody else.

754
01:02:43,732 --> 01:02:44,975
Son of a bitch.

755
01:04:27,575 --> 01:04:31,901
I've got access to the ERV.
I'm gonna go inside.

756
01:04:41,827 --> 01:04:44,113
Terri,
is the oxygen generator okay?

757
01:04:45,286 --> 01:04:49,114
Yeah. It's gonna take a while to get
back to 1 00 percent capacity, though.

758
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:53,407
Okay, I'm entering the hab.

759
01:05:15,122 --> 01:05:17,657
There's still oxygen in here.

760
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,863
This is a little spooky.

761
01:05:21,664 --> 01:05:24,414
I don't like the dark at all.

762
01:05:25,748 --> 01:05:28,071
Need some lights.
Need some lights.

763
01:05:30,165 --> 01:05:32,535
Okay. Where are we?

764
01:05:34,082 --> 01:05:36,120
Here we go.

765
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:40,653
ERV appears to be
structurally intact.

766
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:50,286
Yeah, but just as we thought,
the computers are fried.

767
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:52,454
Copy that.

768
01:05:52,585 --> 01:05:56,448
I got busted filters here.
Clogged intakes.

769
01:05:56,585 --> 01:06:00,116
Hell of a cleanup job,
but so far no major damage.

770
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:02,087
I'm in the greenhouse.

771
01:07:05,258 --> 01:07:08,789
- You gotta see this.
- What is it,Jim?

772
01:07:11,175 --> 01:07:13,213
It's working.

773
01:07:28,385 --> 01:07:30,874
I'll be damned.

774
01:08:25,891 --> 01:08:28,296
- Luke.
- No!

775
01:08:37,684 --> 01:08:40,599
You're not here!
You are not here!

776
01:08:44,601 --> 01:08:47,137
Your wife is Debra.
Your son is Bobby.

777
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:49,638
- No!
- You're reading
Treasure Island with him.

778
01:08:52,436 --> 01:08:54,142
Luke--

779
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:57,515
It's all right.
It's me.

780
01:08:58,895 --> 01:09:01,016
-Jim?
- Yeah.

781
01:09:02,686 --> 01:09:04,926
No, wait! No!
No, no! Wait, wait!

782
01:09:05,062 --> 01:09:07,100
He's all right.
He's all right.

783
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:12,137
Phil? Phil.

784
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,554
Terri.

785
01:09:24,355 --> 01:09:26,559
Jim--Jim, what are you--
what are you--

786
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:28,929
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be--

787
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:31,102
You're not supposed to be here.
How are you here?

788
01:09:31,231 --> 01:09:33,518
- How are you here?
- This is a rescue mission.

789
01:09:35,981 --> 01:09:38,019
Woody wanted me right seat.

790
01:09:43,358 --> 01:09:44,981
I can't--

791
01:09:46,232 --> 01:09:48,189
I can't believe--

792
01:09:58,526 --> 01:10:00,730
Well, where is he?
Where's Woody?

793
01:10:12,693 --> 01:10:14,649
He didn't make it.

794
01:10:29,445 --> 01:10:30,855
God.

795
01:10:32,029 --> 01:10:34,732
Oh. Oh.

796
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,900
Oh, no, no.

797
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:39,945
Oh, God. Oh, no.

798
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:53,614
Well, it works, you know?
I give them...

799
01:10:53,739 --> 01:10:55,860
CO2 and light, and...

800
01:10:55,989 --> 01:10:57,946
they give me oxygen and food.

801
01:10:58,074 --> 01:11:00,479
It's-- It's actually not
a bad arrangement, you know?

802
01:11:00,615 --> 01:11:02,771
It's kind of like
a marriage, really...

803
01:11:02,907 --> 01:11:05,775
except not as many--
not as many fights.

804
01:11:05,907 --> 01:11:09,024
- I mean, some fights.
- Luke. Tell us what happened here.

805
01:11:13,158 --> 01:11:15,114
I--

806
01:11:17,283 --> 01:11:19,238
We fired the radar...

807
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:24,106
and it-- it came,
and they all died.

808
01:11:24,242 --> 01:11:26,945
They all--
They all died.

809
01:11:27,076 --> 01:11:29,197
Wh-What do you mean?
What-- What came?

810
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:32,360
The force came out of the top
of the mountain and-and-and...

811
01:11:32,493 --> 01:11:35,823
everybody died,
but I was spared.

812
01:11:37,618 --> 01:11:40,321
Why? Why?

813
01:11:41,328 --> 01:11:43,283
Had to be for a reason.

814
01:11:45,661 --> 01:11:48,778
And then all of a sudden,
I knew the reason why.

815
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:53,032
It's so someone would be left
to figure out the secret.

816
01:11:55,246 --> 01:11:57,201
You know? It's--

817
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:04,239
J-J-Just come.Just come,
come, come, come, come, come.

818
01:12:06,747 --> 01:12:10,693
Is it just me, or is he a few
meal packs short of a picnic?

819
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:13,912
Long-term exposure to low gravity can
have an adverse impact on the brain.

820
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,914
Or then, he could be suffering
from some form of asphyxia.

821
01:12:20,123 --> 01:12:23,702
Or maybe his whole crew died, and he's
been marooned alone on Mars for a year.

822
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,079
It's a miracle
he's survived this long.

823
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,537
I'd better bring him up to speed.

824
01:12:46,084 --> 01:12:48,454
Great, great.
Great, great, great, great.

825
01:12:52,043 --> 01:12:54,081
So let me be sure
I understand this.

826
01:12:55,251 --> 01:12:58,001
Your ship blew up
with all its supplies.

827
01:12:58,127 --> 01:13:01,079
Then you-- Then you emptied
all the cargo out of the REMO...

828
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:03,616
and it was totalled on landing.

829
01:13:03,752 --> 01:13:07,877
You got no food, no water,
no, no spare oxygen.

830
01:13:09,753 --> 01:13:11,957
Nothing other than
what I'm looking at right here.

831
01:13:16,629 --> 01:13:19,331
What kind-- What kind
of rescue mission is this,Jim?

832
01:13:24,213 --> 01:13:26,085
That kind.

833
01:13:26,213 --> 01:13:29,165
Check it out.
New nav boards for the ERV.

834
01:13:29,297 --> 01:13:31,832
I got four round-trip tickets, baby,
right in here.

835
01:13:35,548 --> 01:13:39,044
Thank you, God!
Oh, thank God.

836
01:13:45,048 --> 01:13:48,414
When I came to and dug myself out
of the sand, my faceplate was cracked.

837
01:13:48,548 --> 01:13:52,330
It was leaking.
Leaking badly.

838
01:13:52,466 --> 01:13:54,504
I barely made it back to base.

839
01:13:55,716 --> 01:13:59,082
It was weeks before I could
work up the nerve to go back
out there and look for--

840
01:14:03,133 --> 01:14:05,171
and look for their bodies.

841
01:14:08,134 --> 01:14:12,957
Reneé was the only one I could find,
but it just didn't seem right somehow
to just dig one grave.

842
01:14:14,218 --> 01:14:16,256
Oh, God.

843
01:14:36,761 --> 01:14:39,049
Has it been blowing like this
for a while?

844
01:14:39,179 --> 01:14:40,553
Yeah.

845
01:14:41,804 --> 01:14:47,174
We saw a big storm on our screens,
but Micker said it was turning south.

846
01:14:47,305 --> 01:14:49,260
If it holds course.

847
01:14:52,805 --> 01:14:56,218
Luke, this--
this whatever it was.

848
01:14:56,347 --> 01:14:59,132
This-- This force.

849
01:15:01,014 --> 01:15:04,096
You said it came directly
out of the top of the mountain?

850
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:07,927
Don't you believe me?

851
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:13,343
That's okay,Jim. You don't believe me,
that's okay, but I'm not crazy.

852
01:15:13,474 --> 01:15:16,675
- I know that much. I'm not crazy.
- What'd you mean by its ""secret""?

853
01:15:18,766 --> 01:15:19,963
What secret?

854
01:15:20,142 --> 01:15:22,595
Listen, hundred of millions
of years have gone by, okay?

855
01:15:22,725 --> 01:15:26,470
You got erosion, lava flow,
sandstorms, meteor impacts.

856
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,757
Hell, in that much time,
the whole surface of the planet
would have changed.

857
01:15:28,892 --> 01:15:30,848
So it's no wonder
we never saw it before.

858
01:15:30,976 --> 01:15:33,132
I mean, we saw it,
but not like they meant us to.

859
01:15:33,268 --> 01:15:36,384
- There was too much dirt on it.
- Saw what, Luke?

860
01:15:38,435 --> 01:15:40,307
Saw this.

861
01:15:51,352 --> 01:15:52,596
Jesus.

862
01:15:54,311 --> 01:15:57,096
Oh, my God. Luke, what are you
trying to tell us?

863
01:15:57,228 --> 01:15:59,978
- You're trying to tell us
that that's a face?
- That's the face.

864
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:04,095
It's the face. It's real.

865
01:16:04,229 --> 01:16:06,266
Somebody put that thing there,
and it's not us.

866
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:08,978
Jim--

867
01:16:12,188 --> 01:16:14,226
It's not possible.

868
01:16:16,814 --> 01:16:19,267
Jesus.

869
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:23,019
Look at that. My God.

870
01:16:25,731 --> 01:16:27,272
I know.

871
01:16:30,107 --> 01:16:32,891
Luke, uh, what--

872
01:16:33,024 --> 01:16:34,979
what about that sound you heard
before the explosion?

873
01:16:35,107 --> 01:16:37,596
Oh, yeah. Good,Jim.
Th-Th-That's the key. That's the key.

874
01:16:48,192 --> 01:16:51,523
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

875
01:16:59,109 --> 01:17:01,231
- It's pauses. Do you hear the pauses?
- Yeah.

876
01:17:05,777 --> 01:17:07,815
See, that's what made me
realize it's a pattern.

877
01:17:09,402 --> 01:17:11,358
It's a repeating pattern.

878
01:17:13,486 --> 01:17:16,354
- Mathematical?
- Mm-hmm. That occurred to me too.

879
01:17:25,404 --> 01:17:27,394
There are distinct blocks
within each pattern...

880
01:17:27,529 --> 01:17:30,231
and within each block,
the tones come in groups of three.

881
01:17:30,363 --> 01:17:34,226
It's three, three, three, three, three,
three. It's always three, three, three.
It's always the same.

882
01:17:34,364 --> 01:17:36,319
And, see, for months
I struggled to analyse it, you know...

883
01:17:36,447 --> 01:17:38,686
trying different constructs,
and then I thought about dimensions.

884
01:17:38,822 --> 01:17:42,069
- X-Y-Z coordinates.
- Exactly. Three groups
equals three dimensions.

885
01:17:42,197 --> 01:17:47,151
So I-I assigned different graphic values
to each block group and tone...

886
01:17:47,281 --> 01:17:49,948
and I came up with this.

887
01:17:58,782 --> 01:18:00,939
- Hello.
- Oh, my God.

888
01:18:02,032 --> 01:18:05,481
- Is that what I think it is?
- DNA?

889
01:18:05,616 --> 01:18:07,654
- You see it?
- Yeah.

890
01:18:09,784 --> 01:18:13,729
- It's a model of DNA.
- So-- So somebody left that thing here.

891
01:18:13,867 --> 01:18:15,942
Okay. Somebody other than human.

892
01:18:18,659 --> 01:18:21,990
But, uh, what is it?

893
01:18:22,118 --> 01:18:24,073
It's a signature.

894
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:29,160
It's a self-portrait
of whatever species created the face.

895
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:36,028
Yeah, but, uh,
that DNA looks human.

896
01:18:36,161 --> 01:18:39,243
- No.
- No, it's not. It's missing
the last pair of chromosomes. See?

897
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:43,115
- This is close. It's damn close.
- ""Close""?

898
01:18:43,245 --> 01:18:46,362
The difference
between man and ape is less than
three percent genetic material.

899
01:18:47,538 --> 01:18:52,823
But that three percent
gives you Einstein, Mozart.

900
01:18:52,955 --> 01:18:54,364
Jack the Ripper.

901
01:18:55,663 --> 01:18:58,068
Yeah, he's right.

902
01:19:16,665 --> 01:19:19,829
Four pallets, oral,
topical medications...

903
01:19:19,957 --> 01:19:23,039
splints, bandages,
one complete med pack.

904
01:19:23,166 --> 01:19:25,868
With eight tubes
of antifungal cream.

905
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,037
Well, at least
we won't rash to death.

906
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:34,623
Luke. How do you feel?

907
01:19:36,042 --> 01:19:38,994
Lighter. A lot lighter.

908
01:19:39,126 --> 01:19:41,163
- Welcome back.
- Thanks, man.

909
01:19:43,334 --> 01:19:46,914
The backup generator is salvageable.
So are two of the solar panels.

910
01:19:47,043 --> 01:19:49,283
I'm pretty sure I can get
the oxygen still back into production.

911
01:19:49,419 --> 01:19:53,911
So we're not in such bad shape,
considering.

912
01:19:54,044 --> 01:19:55,999
That's good, Terri.

913
01:19:58,169 --> 01:19:59,627
Good work.

914
01:20:01,086 --> 01:20:02,627
Jesus.

915
01:20:05,545 --> 01:20:09,870
Look at this.
Phil's idea of absolute essentials.

916
01:20:10,004 --> 01:20:11,662
Of course.

917
01:20:30,214 --> 01:20:32,289
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

918
01:20:34,173 --> 01:20:35,167
My baby.

919
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:39,832
- It's not a signature.
- What?

920
01:20:41,423 --> 01:20:43,628
The noise from the face.
It's not a signature.

921
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:47,334
It's a test.

922
01:20:47,466 --> 01:20:50,251
It's asking us
for the right answer.

923
01:20:50,383 --> 01:20:53,915
It wants us to put in
the missing pair of chromosomes.

924
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:56,005
Why?

925
01:20:56,133 --> 01:20:58,171
To prove that we're human.

926
01:21:00,884 --> 01:21:04,131
We fired radar into that thing,
concentrated radio waves,
and you're saying--

927
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:06,415
Which it interpreted
as the wrong answer.

928
01:21:06,551 --> 01:21:08,507
It's-- It could be like
a security alarm.

929
01:21:08,635 --> 01:21:12,794
When it gets an incorrect response,
it defends itself.

930
01:21:12,927 --> 01:21:15,333
So what happens when it gets
the right answer?

931
01:21:17,053 --> 01:21:20,501
Well, I don't know that, Phil.

932
01:21:23,302 --> 01:21:25,341
But we gotta find out.

933
01:21:39,388 --> 01:21:42,552
Luke, what if we
work this the other way?

934
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:46,259
We figure out which tones would be
equivalent to the missing chromosomes...

935
01:21:46,388 --> 01:21:49,173
and then dub them into
your recording of the signal.

936
01:21:49,305 --> 01:21:52,304
- Is that possible?
- Yeah.

937
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:58,008
- Yeah, I think so.
- Good, good, good.

938
01:21:58,139 --> 01:22:03,924
What about the radar gun? Will it
accept the input so we can transmit
a completed signal back to the face?

939
01:22:04,057 --> 01:22:08,003
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, jim. What if you're wrong?

940
01:22:09,765 --> 01:22:11,804
Whoever goes out there--

941
01:22:13,016 --> 01:22:15,967
I mean,
what if you're wrong? Three people
have already died over that thing.

942
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,640
Four.

943
01:22:21,183 --> 01:22:22,724
Terri.

944
01:22:25,351 --> 01:22:29,973
If we leave here without getting
some answers, they all died in vain.

945
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:33,351
We don't--

946
01:22:34,643 --> 01:22:36,765
We don't have to go out there.

947
01:22:54,896 --> 01:22:58,392
Got a lot of static here.
Something's interfering.

948
01:22:58,521 --> 01:23:01,804
Yeah. The antenna got knocked around
pretty badly in the blast.

949
01:23:01,938 --> 01:23:04,723
This is the best resolution
I think we're gonna be able to get.

950
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:08,635
All right, guys. I got the nav boards.
I'm sealing the airlock.

951
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:17,230
- Check the video feed.
- Video feed looks good.

952
01:23:20,648 --> 01:23:23,481
- How close do we have to get?
- I'm not sure.

953
01:23:24,649 --> 01:23:26,686
Maybe I'll stop it
right over there by that rock.

954
01:23:30,107 --> 01:23:31,730
Do it. Good.

955
01:24:05,945 --> 01:24:09,108
Okay. Here we go.

956
01:24:55,074 --> 01:24:56,318
Look at that,Jim.

957
01:24:57,533 --> 01:25:01,148
It worked.
Oh, God, it worked.

958
01:25:01,283 --> 01:25:05,324
Guys, I don't know
what the hell we just did...

959
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:08,863
but does that look to you
like a hostile gesture?

960
01:25:08,993 --> 01:25:13,200
No. More like an invitation.

961
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:16,366
Or another test.

962
01:25:18,618 --> 01:25:20,693
- Check for radiation.
- Normal.

963
01:25:21,868 --> 01:25:24,985
Seismic: Normal.
Anemometer: Steady.

964
01:25:27,077 --> 01:25:28,487
Luke...

965
01:25:30,578 --> 01:25:32,533
does the rover still work?

966
01:25:43,704 --> 01:25:45,742
Phil, do you read?

967
01:25:45,871 --> 01:25:49,782
Uh, yeah,Jim, your signal's breaking up
a little in the storm, but I read you.

968
01:25:49,913 --> 01:25:51,950
We're at the face.

969
01:25:53,163 --> 01:25:55,569
We're gonna need a few minutes here.
Same deadline.

970
01:25:57,997 --> 01:26:00,830
Launch at 1 950 with
or without us. Copy?

971
01:26:02,998 --> 01:26:04,704
Copy that.

972
01:26:05,707 --> 01:26:09,452
Jim.
You sure you wanna do this?

973
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,662
I'm not sure
about anything any more.

974
01:26:15,124 --> 01:26:19,332
But I didn't come 1 00 million miles
just to turn back in the last ten feet.

975
01:26:27,126 --> 01:26:28,534
Yeah.

976
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:41,739
Please work.

977
01:26:43,293 --> 01:26:44,834
It's gonna work.

978
01:26:49,169 --> 01:26:52,286
Yes. Yes.
Computers are on-line.

979
01:26:53,545 --> 01:26:57,290
I am gonna start loading software.

980
01:27:08,254 --> 01:27:10,376
The surface...

981
01:27:10,505 --> 01:27:12,460
seems firm and level.

982
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:15,585
Roger that.

983
01:27:15,713 --> 01:27:17,669
The texture's smooth.

984
01:27:18,839 --> 01:27:21,587
I've got good footing.
No obstructions.

985
01:27:22,881 --> 01:27:25,001
- Let's check our PSI.
- Okay.

986
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,293
Guys, I gotta tell you...

987
01:27:29,423 --> 01:27:32,421
we're losing visibility here
really fast. Over.

988
01:27:32,548 --> 01:27:34,918
It's solid. We're trapped.

989
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:39,787
Don't move.
Just keep this orientation.

990
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:44,548
Guys?

991
01:27:46,925 --> 01:27:48,880
Luke? Terri? Jim?

992
01:27:50,051 --> 01:27:52,088
Phil, can you still hear me?

993
01:27:53,008 --> 01:27:56,126
Is anyone there? Over.

994
01:28:04,593 --> 01:28:06,549
God. That's it.

995
01:28:07,885 --> 01:28:10,588
There's no handles. We're not getting
out of here unless they let us out.

996
01:28:41,639 --> 01:28:43,843
-Jim.Jim, what are you doing?
-Jim, what are you doing?

997
01:28:43,972 --> 01:28:45,300
-Jim.Jim, your suit!
- Stop. Stop it!
Jim, you're depressurizing.

998
01:28:45,431 --> 01:28:47,386
- Seal your suit.
- Come on!
- Seal your suit now!

999
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:57,845
There's pressure in here.

1000
01:28:57,974 --> 01:29:02,347
Above Mars atmospheric?
It's impossible.

1001
01:29:04,891 --> 01:29:07,890
We're millions of miles from Earth
inside a giant white face.

1002
01:29:08,017 --> 01:29:09,972
What's impossible?

1003
01:29:11,559 --> 01:29:13,135
There's 1 2 PSI in here.

1004
01:29:14,601 --> 01:29:17,468
Nitrogen and oxygen.

1005
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,557
Otherwise known as air.

1006
01:29:32,811 --> 01:29:35,808
Hey, wait,Jim. I haven't checked
for lethal trace gases, and I haven't--

1007
01:29:39,895 --> 01:29:41,269
What the hell.

1008
01:31:29,864 --> 01:31:31,238
Look.

1009
01:31:39,615 --> 01:31:43,277
- That what I think it is?
- Yeah. It's Mars.

1010
01:33:18,584 --> 01:33:20,539
That's where they went.

1011
01:33:25,251 --> 01:33:28,830
Look. One stayed behind.

1012
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:55,991
Earth,
before the continents separated.

1013
01:34:07,921 --> 01:34:10,706
My God. That's it.

1014
01:34:10,838 --> 01:34:12,794
Hundreds of millions of years ago...

1015
01:34:12,922 --> 01:34:15,707
there was a sudden explosion
of life on Earth.

1016
01:34:17,089 --> 01:34:21,083
The first multi-celled plants
and animals appeared.

1017
01:34:21,214 --> 01:34:24,213
No one has ever understood
why or how it happened.

1018
01:35:30,222 --> 01:35:32,177
They seeded Earth.

1019
01:35:38,139 --> 01:35:40,094
They're us.

1020
01:35:42,223 --> 01:35:43,337
We're them.

1021
01:36:10,684 --> 01:36:13,173
Luke? Terri? Jim? Anyone?

1022
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:15,347
ERV to rover.
Rover, this is ERV.

1023
01:36:15,476 --> 01:36:18,012
Does anyone copy?
Does anyone copy?

1024
01:36:27,686 --> 01:36:31,134
ERVto rover.
Rover, this is ERV. Do you copy?

1025
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:33,343
- Phil?
- Oh, thank God, I got you.

1026
01:36:33,478 --> 01:36:36,725
- Phil, we read you.
- Listen, the storm
is getting bad, really bad.

1027
01:36:36,853 --> 01:36:39,805
It's gonna totally sock us in
in a few minutes. You've got
to get back to the ship.

1028
01:36:39,937 --> 01:36:42,472
- Phil?
- I repeat, you've got to
get back to the ship.

1029
01:36:42,604 --> 01:36:44,013
Phil?

1030
01:36:45,855 --> 01:36:47,478
We're in a ship.

1031
01:36:50,563 --> 01:36:53,561
This is a ship.

1032
01:36:54,772 --> 01:36:58,387
And the countdown's
already started.

1033
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:02,095
- He's right.
- Yeah.

1034
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:04,305
Yeah, let's-- let's get
the hell out of here.

1035
01:37:07,607 --> 01:37:09,313
Jim?

1036
01:37:10,606 --> 01:37:11,601
Jim.

1037
01:37:14,690 --> 01:37:17,642
Come on. We gotta go.

1038
01:37:17,774 --> 01:37:20,975
- I'm not coming with you.
- What?

1039
01:37:23,025 --> 01:37:24,980
What are you talking about?

1040
01:37:26,608 --> 01:37:27,805
We've gotta get home.

1041
01:37:29,442 --> 01:37:31,397
That's where I'm going.

1042
01:37:33,609 --> 01:37:35,232
Don't you see?

1043
01:37:36,901 --> 01:37:39,934
That's-- That's what
all this is for.

1044
01:37:42,610 --> 01:37:46,390
Terri, you were right.
This is an invitation.

1045
01:37:47,777 --> 01:37:50,265
This is an invitation for us
to follow them home.

1046
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,610
I'm going.

1047
01:37:58,403 --> 01:38:00,440
It's what I was born for.

1048
01:38:03,029 --> 01:38:04,984
Like Maggie said:

1049
01:38:06,445 --> 01:38:10,142
""To stand on a new world and--
and look beyond it...

1050
01:38:11,571 --> 01:38:12,768
to the next one.''

1051
01:38:16,988 --> 01:38:18,944
I know this is right.

1052
01:38:21,405 --> 01:38:22,519
For me.

1053
01:38:24,781 --> 01:38:28,478
And you're running out of time.
You gotta get back to the ERV
and you gotta get off this planet.

1054
01:38:39,824 --> 01:38:41,861
Thank you
for saving my life, buddy.

1055
01:38:43,282 --> 01:38:44,905
It was a privilege.

1056
01:39:03,785 --> 01:39:05,906
I wish Woody
were here to see you.

1057
01:39:08,994 --> 01:39:10,949
He is here, Terri.

1058
01:39:12,161 --> 01:39:14,235
We wouldn't have made it
without him.

1059
01:39:29,204 --> 01:39:31,241
He would have wanted you
to have this.

1060
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:19,538
ERV to rover.
Rover, this is ERV. Do you copy?

1061
01:40:26,918 --> 01:40:30,201
ERV to rover.
Rover, this is ERV. Do you read me?

1062
01:40:35,294 --> 01:40:37,913
Phil, this is Luke.
Do you copy?

1063
01:40:46,504 --> 01:40:49,620
- He's not reading me.
- I can barely read you.

1064
01:40:49,754 --> 01:40:52,538
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Yeah.

1065
01:41:48,551 --> 01:41:52,592
I've lost the base camp beacon.
We're driving blind.

1066
01:41:52,718 --> 01:41:55,965
I'm just gonna keep going on a straight
line, okay? That's our only chance.

1067
01:42:08,095 --> 01:42:11,792
- 1 949. Terri, we're not gonna make it.
- No.

1068
01:42:11,929 --> 01:42:16,503
I've worked with Phil for four years,
and I know Jim gave him a direct order,
but he is not gonna leave without us.

1069
01:42:17,304 --> 01:42:20,007
Please. Luke?

1070
01:42:20,138 --> 01:42:22,259
Terri? Jim?

1071
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:25,050
ERV to rover.

1072
01:42:26,389 --> 01:42:28,628
Rover, this is ERV.
Do you read me?

1073
01:42:28,763 --> 01:42:32,924
Phil, do you read?
This is Luke. We're coming in. Phil.

1074
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:38,132
- Phil!
- Phil isn't here right now.

1075
01:42:38,265 --> 01:42:40,967
He, uh, left for Earth
five minutes ago!

1076
01:42:41,099 --> 01:42:43,219
Please leave a message
after the beep!

1077
01:43:33,187 --> 01:43:34,845
Where is Jim?

1078
01:43:38,729 --> 01:43:40,186
He caught another ride.

1079
01:45:39,741 --> 01:45:43,024
- Dear God, look at that.
- Is that him?

1080
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,237
Have a great ride,Jim.
